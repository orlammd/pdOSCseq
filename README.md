=======

A sequence file is composed by:
* a number of steps, this has to be manually set in the "number of steps" part of the file,
* an OSC prefix: this is the common part of every OSC messages that this sequence will send. If no common part exists, let it empty,
* a list of by-step OSC messages which will be sent each time the matching step will be encountered.
